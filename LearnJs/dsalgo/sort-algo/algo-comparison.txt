Bubble Sort  vs Selection Sort vs Insertion Sort
-------------------------------------------------

Scenario: If we have fairly sorted data :
    - Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort is the better choice
    - Selection will traverse again and again selecting the minimum element and find the lowest from current selected
