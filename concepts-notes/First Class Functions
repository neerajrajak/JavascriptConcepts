First Class Functions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==> Function Statement vs Function Expression

	**Function Statement is a normal function we define like, it is also known as function declaration
	
	function a(){
	  console.log("a called");
	}
	
	**Function expression is a variable holding anonomous function
	**Anonomous function cannot be called by its own, it has to be assigned to a variable
	
	var b = function(){
	   console.log("b called"); 
	}
	
	In both the cases the output will be driven based on the function call
	
	a();
	b();

	function a(){
	  console.log("a called");
	}
	
	var b = function(){
	   console.log("b called"); 
	}
	
	a();
	b();
	
	But if we call the function statement before it is declared we will get the same output, but in case of function expression we will get an error
	that function is not defined, this is because function a will be allocated a memory before it is called, but since function b is assigned to a 
	variable and hence if we try to access before it is called it will return an error since memory is not assigned.
	
	**Named Function: Named function is a function with name assigned to a variable in function expression
	
	var b = function xyz(){
	   console.log("b called"); 
	}
	
==> Parameter vs Arguments

	var demo = function(param1, param2){
	   console.log(param1, param2); 
	}

	let arg1 = 10;
	let arg2 = 20;
	demo(arg1, arg2);
	
	Parameter forms a part of function definition like above param1, param2 and it is local to the function and has no access to its outer scope.
	Arguments forms a part of values used to call a function, like arg1, arg2
	Both the terms are used interchangebly many times but is not same, they are different
	
==> First Class Function/ First Class Citizen:
		The ability of function to be passed as a value, to be passed as an argument and to be returned from a function is called First Class Function
		
	- Function passed as a value:	
	  var b = function(){
	   console.log("b called"); 
	  }
	 
	- Function passed as an argument
		
		function demo(functionAsParam){
		  console.log(functionAsParam);
		}
		
		demo(function(){
			console.log("See my definition from demo function argument);
		});
		
	- Function return from another another function
	
		function demo(){
			return function(){
			  console.log("I am another function returned from Demo");
			}
		}
		
		demo()();
